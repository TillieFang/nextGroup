# nextGroup

This is the group project for the subject 42889 iOS Application Development.

Our goal is to design a user-friendly application with an efficient navigational flow that makes it simple for UTS students to reserve a study space or room at UTS, which would in turn motivate students to make the most of these amenities available to them.
